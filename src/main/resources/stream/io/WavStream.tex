This stream implementation provides access to WAV samples that are
read from a URL. The wav samples are read in small chunks (blocks),
depending on the {\ttfamily blockSize} parameter of this stream.
Each item provided by this stream contains a double array of
{\ttfamily blockSize} values (samples).

By default the samples are stored in attribute {\ttfamily wav:samples}.
Additional information may be included in the first item of the stream,
such as {\ttfamily wav:samplerate}, {\ttfamily wav:channels} or the
number of bytes per sample ({\ttfamily wav:bytesPerSample}.
