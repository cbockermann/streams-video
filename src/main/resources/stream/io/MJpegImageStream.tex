\Stream{MjpegImageStream}
\label{sec:stream.io.MjpegImageStream}

This class implements a stream for sequences of JPEG images. The format is often
called {\em mjpeg} and consists of frames, each compressed to the JPEG format by
itself.


The items produced by this stream contain a single attribute {\ttfamily frame:image},
containing the decoded bitmap image as object of class {\ttfamily ImageRGB}.
