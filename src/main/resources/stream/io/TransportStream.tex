\Stream{TransportStream}
\label{sec:stream.io.TransportStream}

This class implements a simple stream of packets obtained from a transport
stream. Each packet has a size of 188 bytes. The data items emitted by this
stream contain the packet data (in {\ttfamily packet:data}) and the packet
identifier (in {\ttfamily packet:id}).

Additional attributes provided in each item are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\ttfamily packet:offset} - the number of bytes this packet starts from the start of the stream
  \item {\ttfamily packet:sequence} - the sequence number of this packet from the stream (first packet is $0$)
\end{itemize}
