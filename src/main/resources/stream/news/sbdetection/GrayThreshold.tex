This processor classifies the incoming frames as "shot boundaries" or "no shot boundary" based on the DiffImages of two successive frames. It can only be applied, after the DiffImage has already been calculated. If the average gray value of the DiffImages exceeds a given threshold t, the frame is labeled as a "shot boundary".
