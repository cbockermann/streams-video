This processor classifies a news video into anchorshots and news report shots, by matching each shot against an image, representing an anchorshot model. Pixels, that are black in the model, get ignored, all other pixels get compared pixel-wise. If the difference between the current image and the model does not exceed a given threshold t, the shot is predicted to be an anchorshot.
