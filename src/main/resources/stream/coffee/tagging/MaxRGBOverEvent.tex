This processor determines the minimal RGB color values observed during the actual event. If the frame does not belong to an event (@prediction:event = false), no action is performed. As soon as a series of event frames start, the minimal color value for all color channels is remembered and the minimal values observed so far are added to the data item. Hence the last data item of the series holds the minimal color values for the whole event.
