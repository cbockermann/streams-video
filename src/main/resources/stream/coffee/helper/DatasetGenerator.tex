This processor creates a dataset, containing only one data item for each coffee capsule event. If the last data item belonged to an event, but the current does not, the minimal RGB values for that event plus the label are returned. All other data items are simply dropped. The minimal color values observed during the event have to be included in the data item already. This can be done using the stream.coffee.tagging.MaxRGBOverEvent processor.
