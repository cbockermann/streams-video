This processor adds the true label to the video frames of one coffee capsule video file. One label is attached to each data item: @label:event, telling, the color of the coffee capsule slipping down the slide or "no event", in case no capsule is shown within the frame (multinominal).

The labels have to be stored in a file, that gets read in before the stream process starts (during the init of this processor).
